1. **Import your data** with `read.csv()` or another appropriate function and check
that the importation process gives no errors.

2. **Convert to data.frame or data.table** if needed `(my.data <- data.frame(DATA)`
and set column names `(names(my.data) <- c(...))` if needed.

3. **Examine dimensions** - use `dim()` to check that the data frame has the expected number of rows and columns.

4. **Examine head/tail of data** - Use `head()` and `tail(my.data)` to check the first few and last few rows;
make sure that header rows at the beginning and blank rows at the end were
not included accidentally. Also check that no good rows were skipped at the
beginning.

5. **Spotcheck data** - Use `some()` from the **car** package to examine a few sets of random rows.


6. **Check the data.frame structure** - Use `str()` to ensure that variable types and
values are appropriate. Change the type of variables???especially to factor
types???as necessary.

7. **Get summary stats** - Run `summary()` and look for unexpected values, especially min and max that are unexpected.

8. **Get detailed summary** - Load the **psych** library and examine basic descriptives with `describe()`. Reconfirm the observation counts by checking that n is the same for each variable, and check trimmed mean and skew (if relevant).

9. **Test for normality** - Use `qqnorm()` and `qqline()` to test normality assumptions. 

10 . **Specific transformations** - as needed for statistical assumptions (e.g., `log()`)

Variable | Common Transform
-------- | ----------------
sales, revenue, income, price | `log(x`
distance | `1/x`, `1/x^2`, `log(x)`
market share, preference share | `(e^x)/(1+e^x)`
right-tailed dist | `sqrt(x)`, `log(x)` caution log(x<=0)
left-tailed dist | `x^2`

11. **General transformation** - when specific transformations don't work, use Box-Cox transformation. Use package **car** to `lambda <- coef(powerTransform())` to compute lambda and then call `bcPower()` to transform. Consider Box???Cox transformations on all variables with
skewed distributions before computing correlations or creating scatterplots.

12. **Examine correlation** - Use `pairs()` to show scatterplots of all variables. Function `scatterplotMatrix()` in package **car** is pairs-on-steroids. Another possibility is `gpairs()` in package **gpairs** which provides better visualization for factors.

13. **More correlation** - For continuous variables use `cor()` to compute Pearson's correlation coefficient. *Cohen's Rules of Thumb:* r=0.1 *small/weak*; r=0.3 *medium*; r>=0.5 *large/strong* (assuming normal distribution; transform if needed). Use `cor.test()` to compute p-value.

14. **Multivariable correlation** - For multiple variable correlation compute a correlation matrix by calling `cor()` with multiple variables. Packages **corrplot** and **gplots** provide `corplott()` and `corrplot.mixed()` to plot graphical vizualiations of correlation.
